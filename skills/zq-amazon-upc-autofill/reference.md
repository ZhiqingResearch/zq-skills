# zq-amazon-upc-autofill — reference

Load this when you need the template mechanics, the Keepa→field mapping, or the
source-combination rules. The main workflow is in `SKILL.md`.

## How Amazon flat-file templates are structured

Every Amazon category template follows the same shape, so the scripts are generic:

- The **`Template`** sheet holds the data. Its `A1` cell contains a settings string
  encoding the layout — `parse_template.py` reads `labelRow`, `attributeRow`, and
  `dataRow` from it (commonly 4 / 5 / 8):
  - **label row** — human-readable field labels
  - **attribute row** — technical attribute names (the keys `write_values.py` uses)
  - **data row** — first row of actual product data; one product per row below it
- The **`Data Definitions`** sheet documents every field. Its header row has:
  `Group Name | Field Name | Local Label Name | Accepted Values | Example | Required?`
  - **Field Name** matches the attribute row in `Template`.
  - **Accepted Values** is the filling rule (format, units, allowed values).
  - **Required?** is one of `Required`, `Conditionally Required`, `Recommended`,
    `Optional`.
- **`Valid Values`** / **`Dropdown Lists`** back the in-cell dropdowns. When a field
  is enumerated, the value you write **must** be one of these exact strings.

For the sample `NOTEBOOK_COMPUTER.xlsm`: 513 columns, **9 Required** + **131
Conditionally Required** fields.

## The 9 strictly-Required fields (sample template)

| Field | Typical source |
| ----- | -------------- |
| SKU | user-provided / generated |
| Product Type | from the template itself |
| Item Name (title) | Keepa `title` → web search to refine |
| Brand Name | Keepa `brand` |
| Product Id Type | `UPC` (constant) |
| Product Description | Keepa/web; follow length + HTML rules |
| Bullet Point | Keepa `bullet_points` / web |
| Country of Origin | **compliance — never inferred**; user-confirmed source only |
| Dangerous Goods Regulations | **compliance — never inferred**; `needs_user_input` if unconfirmed |

Conditionally-Required spec fields (screen size, RAM, CPU, storage, weight, …)
are filled when Keepa/web provide them.

## Keepa → template field mapping

`keepa_lookup.py` normalizes Keepa into these keys; map them onto the field whose
`accepted_values` fits:

| Keepa key | Fills (examples) |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| `asin` | UPC→ASIN bridge for the ASIN-enrichment lookup; not a template field |
| `brand` | Brand Name |
| `manufacturer` | Manufacturer |
| `title` | Item Name (refine to the rule's length/format) |
| `model` / `part_number` | Model Number / Model Name |
| `category_tree` | Item Type Keyword / browse hints |
| `bullet_points` | Bullet Point (one per bullet field) |
| `description` | Product Description |
| `color` / `size` | Color / Size |
| `package_dimensions_cm` + `package_weight_g` | package length/width/height/weight (convert to the unit the rule wants) |
| `item_dimensions_cm` + `item_weight_g` | item dimensions/weight |
| `images` | Main / Other Image URL |

Keepa dimensions are normalized to **cm** (from mm) and weight stays in **grams** —
convert to whatever unit the field's `accepted_values` specifies.

## Source combination (parallel, not fallback)

Keepa and web search are **two independent sources used together**. For each UPC,
gather both, then per field:

1. The **filling rule wins** — the value must match `accepted_values`.
2. **When Keepa and web agree**, use that value (`confidence: high`) — agreement is
   also the main identity signal.
3. **When they differ**, pick the value that fits the rule and is better-sourced —
   prefer the brand/manufacturer spec page, or a Keepa record whose `upc_verified`
   is true — and record both readings in `evidence`.
4. Use one source to **fill what the other lacks** (Keepa is UPC-native and
   structured; web reaches brand spec pages, datasheets, enumerated values like
   Country of Origin).

Keepa is *not* a primary with web as backup — the goal is a synthesized, cross-
checked value per field.

**Keepa is paid (spends tokens).** The skill asks the user up front whether to use
it; if declined, it fills from web search only, then offers a Keepa "top-up" if the
web-only pass leaves required fields blank or identity unconfirmed (see SKILL.md
step 2). Keepa entry points: exact by UPC (`code`), by ASIN (`--asin`), and keyword
search (`--search "<brand model>"`, higher token cost) — the last returns candidate
products with their `upc_list` so you can verify the match.

## How field rules are validated

The template describes fields in two forms; each is enforced differently:

- **Dropdown / enum values** — the machine-enforceable form, in the sheet's data
  validations. `resolve_valid_values.py` resolves them (named range / INDIRECT /
  Dropdown Lists); `write_values.py` **hard-fails** on an illegal value and
  `validate_output.py` re-checks. This is the constraint that actually gets a
  listing rejected, and it is enforced authoritatively.
- **`accepted_values` prose** (Data Definitions) — mostly descriptive guidance the
  agent follows. Where it states a machine-readable constraint (e.g. "maximum 200
  characters", "value between 1 and 10", "numeric"), `field_rules.py` parses and
  **enforces it as an ERROR**. Otherwise `field_rules.json` supplies common Amazon
  length/numeric limits (title 200, bullet 500, description 2000, …) checked as
  **WARN** (heuristic, editable per category/marketplace).

Not derived (would be unreliable): the `Conditions List` sheet encodes conditional
requirements as value-combination lists referenced by INDIRECT formulas, not a
clean "field X required when Y" table — so conditional-requirement *triggers* are
not auto-evaluated; fields are bucketed by their stated Required level only.

## Inferred values

A value is **inferred** when it isn't confirmed by any source (an educated guess
to satisfy a Required field). `write_values.py` fills those cells with a
background color (default `FFE0B2`, light orange). This is cosmetic — it does not
affect Amazon's server-side validation on upload — but lets the user review every
guess at a glance. Always also list inferred fields in the report.
